Operating system used: MacOS
IDE used: Xcode

Instructions:
Run the 'ar.cpp' file which displays the output video stream, with detected corners on a checkerboard (if found).
- Press 'x' to display 3D axes.
- Press 'o' to display virtual objects.
- Press 'r' to display Harris corners.
- Press 's' to save current image frame for calibration. If more than 5 frames are saved continuous calibration starts automatically.
- Press 'c' to save current calibration in a CSV file.
- Press 'p' to take a screenshot of current displayed video frame.


Extensions:
-> Get your AR system working with a target other than the checkerboard. An asymmetric circle grid is used here.
-> Not only add a virtual object but also do something to the target to make it not look like a target anymore.

Navigate to the 'extensions' folder and run the 'ar_extend.cpp' file which displays the output video stream, with detected centers on the asymmetric circle grid (if found).
- Press 'x' to display 3D axes.
- Press 'o' to display virtual objects.
- Press 't' to transform target into art canvas.
- Press 's' to save current image frame for calibration. If more than 5 frames are saved continuous calibration starts automatically.
- Press 'c' to save current calibration in a CSV file.
- Press 'p' to take a screenshot of current displayed video frame.
